# **Don't Stop Studying! â€“ Smart Reminders for Anki**

This add-on for Anki displays automatic reminders to get back to studying, even when you're browsing outside of review mode, and also detects inactivity during reviews to help you stay focused and disciplined.

## **Features**

- **Periodic Reminder:** Shows a popup in the corner of the screen after a configurable interval, if you are outside review mode.
- **Inactivity Detection:** If enabled, monitors inactivity during review and shows a popup after the configured extra time.
- **Easy Configuration:** GUI to choose deck, reminder frequency, enable/disable the feature, and adjust inactivity time.
- **Modern Popup:** Stylish window with quick action buttons for "Study Now" or "Later".
- **Smart Window Management:** When clicking "Study Now", the Anki window is restored and brought to front already in review mode.
