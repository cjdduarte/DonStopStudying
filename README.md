### **Features**
- **Periodic reminder:** Shows a popup in the corner of the screen after a configurable interval, if you are outside review mode.
- **Inactivity detection:** If enabled, monitors inactivity during review and shows a popup after the configured extra time.
- **Easy configuration:** GUI to choose deck, reminder frequency, enable/disable the feature, and adjust inactivity time.
- **Modern popup:** Stylish window with quick action buttons for "Study Now" or "Later".
- **Smart window management:** When clicking "Study Now", the Anki window is restored and brought to front already in review mode.

### **How It Works**

1. **Periodic Reminder**
   - The add-on starts a timer as soon as Anki is opened.
   - If you are outside review mode (e.g., browsing decks, menus, etc.), when the configured time is reached, a popup appears suggesting you get back to studying.
   - If you are reviewing, the periodic reminder is postponed until you leave review mode.
   - The timer resets when you return to the main screen.

2. **Inactivity Reminder**
   - If enabled in settings, the add-on monitors the maximum allowed time to answer each card.
   - When the card's time runs out, a second timer starts ("extra inactivity time").
   - If you remain inactive, a popup appears alerting you to resume studying.
   - This feature can be enabled/disabled in the settings.

3. **Reminder Popup**
   - Shows the configured deck and allows you to start reviewing immediately or postpone the reminder.
   - The "Study Now" button brings Anki to the front already in review mode.
   - The "Later" button closes the popup and restarts the timer.

### **Technical Details**

- The add-on uses Qt timers to control reminders.
- Uses Anki hooks to detect start/end of review and control inactivity reminders.
- The popup is an independent window, always visible even if Anki is minimized (but not closed).
- The timer is paused during review and resumes when returning to the main screen.
